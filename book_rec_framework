#This program first loads a database of books and their corresponding ISBN numbers, as well as information about their content and genre. It then uses the given ISBN numbers to retrieve the corresponding books from the database.

Next, the program uses machine learning algorithms to compare the books you've read and recommend a similar book. Finally, it returns the recommended book.

Of course, this is just an example of how such a program might work. In order to create a working program, you would need to implement the specific details, such as the database of books and the machine learning algorithms used to recommend a book.
